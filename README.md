One cup of fresh orange juice has 124 mg of vitamin C, which is 200% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin C for an adult. With this as (completely unrelated) motivation, your task is to build a model to predict whether a grocery store customer will Purchase Citrus Hill (CH) or Minute Maid (MM) orange juice.
TASKS
1.	[Text] Choose an appropriate metric to analyze a modelâ€™s performance. Justify.
2.	[Code] Build a prediction model as follows:
a.	Preprocess the data however you see fit. In code comments, describe what you did and why.
b.	Split the data into training and testing sets. In code comments, describe what you did and why.
c.	Build three different models, using three different machine learning algorithms. (Any three will do.) Tune each model. Print out the best hyperparameter values for each model. Print out performance of each fine-tuned model.
3.	[Text] Using business language (not technical language), describe and compare the performance of each fine-tuned model.
4.	[Text] Overall, which model is best suited to this business problem? Justify.
5.	[Text] Is this model good enough to deploy today? Justify. If you had more time, how could you make the performance of your model better?
